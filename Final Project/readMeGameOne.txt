Purpose:
This game is a puzzle game. The image is the painting 'Relativity' by M C Escher. The Pieces are all draggable. 
Drag and drop the pieces to recreate the painting. They all fit together a little different so keep trying until the photo
is complete.

Issues:
The edges of the puzzle pieces are not exact, especially to the right side of the pieces. this can be a problem when you
try to select one piece and accidently grab another

Plans to resolve issues:
I think the issue is that the pieces are not evenly shaped, but are oddly cropped .png's. I think if I used a diffent 
picture format those issues might stop.

Future release:
I would have liked to have more than 9 pieces to the puzzle.
