Purpose:
This game is a pong game. A ball bounces between two paddles. One paddle is controlled by the player and 
the other by the computer. The object of the game is to bounce the ball past the other player's paddle.

Issues:
I tried for a while to flip the whole board 90 degress sideways but that proved to be a major headache. That said I think
it would be nicer in landscape.

Plans to resolve issues:
If I had way more time to spend on that I propbably could have gotten it but I spent alot of my time creating the scoreing
system instead which I felt was more important.

Future release:
I would like to intergrate the score board into the game window but I did the best I could.
