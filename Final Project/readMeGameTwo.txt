Purpose:
This game is a maze game. A UFO sprite moves from left to right and the player must guide it through a series of 
oddly shaped pillars. If you touch a pillar the game ends. YOu can move up, down, left or right via the buttons above 
the game canvas.

Issues:
There is no refresh button to start again, you have to just reresh the page.

Plans to resolve issues:
Adding a button to reset the game board by the movement keys would fix the problem.

Future release:
a reset button and a score board would both be nice.
